I have a Python file named layoutlmv3_trainer.py (content provided below). I need you to act as an expert Python engineer and machine learning specialist, and perform targeted, comprehensive enhancements on this file.

Your primary objective is to optimize and robustly refactor this layoutlmv3_trainer.py to achieve the best possible performance for training a LayoutLMv3 model for invoice information extraction (NER). Crucially, it must seamlessly integrate with and rely on our DataPreparationUtils module for all data loading and preprocessing, aligning perfectly with our project's data pipeline.

Adhere strictly to the following plan for the updated layoutlmv3_trainer.py file:

Centralize Data Loading via DataPreparationUtils:

Remove KaggleInvoiceDataLoader class: This class is now redundant as DataPreparationUtils (which resides in core/data_preparation_utils.py) is our centralized data loader for invoice annotations.

Refactor main() function's data loading:

Import DataPreparationUtils from core.data_preparation_utils.

In the main() function, instantiate DataPreparationUtils.

Use data_utils.load_kaggle_invoice_dataset(KAGGLE_INVOICES_DIR) and data_utils.load_synthetic_invoice_dataset(SYNTHETIC_INVOICES_DIR) to load raw annotation data.

Then, use data_utils.unify_dataset_format(all_loaded_samples) to get the unified list of samples.

Finally, use data_utils.create_train_val_split(unified_samples, VAL_SPLIT) to get train_data and val_data. This fully delegates data loading and initial processing to DataPreparationUtils.

Dynamic Label and ID Mapping Generation:

Remove hardcoded self.base_labels and self.ner_tag_translation_map from the trainer. These mappings should primarily reside and be managed by the DataPreparationUtils if it performs the initial NER tag unification or provided dynamically.

The LayoutLMv3Learner (or a helper function in main()) needs to dynamically create id_to_label and label_to_id mappings based on the actual unique NER tags present in the unified_samples loaded from DataPreparationUtils. This ensures the model's output layer perfectly matches the unique labels in your combined dataset.

Pass this dynamically generated id_to_label_map to the LayoutLMv3Learner and LayoutLMDataset constructors.

Optimize Bounding Box Handling and Validation Flow:

The DataPreparationUtils.unify_dataset_format (and its helpers like _clean_bounding_boxes) should already be responsible for converting/normalizing bounding boxes to the 0-1000 range.

Remove normalize_bbox and validate_and_fix_bbox functions from layoutlmv3_trainer.py if they are redundant because DataPreparationUtils is now handling this.

In LayoutLMDataset.__getitem__, keep only a minimal assertion or final bounds check for validated_boxes to ensure they are within the 0-1000 range as expected by LayoutLMv3Processor, but avoid re-normalization if it's already done by DataPreparationUtils.

Enhance Training Robustness and Efficiency:

Early Stopping: Add EarlyStoppingCallback to the Trainer callbacks to prevent overfitting. Configure it to monitor f1_micro (or f1_weighted) with a reasonable early_stopping_patience (e.g., 3 epochs) and an optional early_stopping_threshold.

Mixed Precision Training (FP16): Ensure fp16=True is conditionally enabled in TrainingArguments if a CUDA-enabled GPU is detected (torch.cuda.is_available()).

Gradient Accumulation: Consider adding gradient_accumulation_steps to TrainingArguments if BATCH_SIZE is small, to simulate a larger effective batch size and potentially improve stability/performance.

Logging and Saving Strategy: Ensure eval_strategy="steps" and save_strategy="steps" are used with eval_steps and save_steps set to meaningful intervals (e.g., after a certain number of batches or a fraction of an epoch), as this provides more granular feedback than epoch.

dataloader_num_workers: Keep dataloader_num_workers=0 for Windows compatibility.

Refine LayoutLMDataset:

Ensure the __getitem__ method correctly accesses tokens and bboxes from the item dictionary, assuming DataPreparationUtils.unify_dataset_format provides these keys.

Streamline LayoutLMv3Learner:

The compute_metrics method is generally good. Ensure it robustly handles cases where true_labels or true_predictions might be empty.

The model saving logic is fine.

Cleanup and Documentation:

Remove any unused imports.

Update docstrings for all modified methods and classes to reflect their new responsibilities and parameters.

Maintain the consistent logging style.

Update if __name__ == "__main__": to align with the new data loading flow and demonstrate model training.

Your final output should be the complete, updated layoutlmv3_trainer.py file only, implementing all these specific changes and optimizations. with complete research made
