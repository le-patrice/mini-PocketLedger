I have a Python file named layoutlmv3_trainer.py (content provided below). I need you to act as an expert machine learning engineer with a focus on deep learning model training, and perform precise optimizations and integration checks on this file.

Your primary objective is to ensure this layoutlmv3_trainer.py trains the LayoutLMv3 model for invoice information extraction (NER) using data prepared exclusively by our comprehensive DataPreparationUtils module. It must be robust, efficient, and capable of standalone execution for training purposes.

Adhere strictly to the following plan for the updated layoutlmv3_trainer.py file:

Confirm DataPreparationUtils Integration:

Verify that DataPreparationUtils is correctly imported: from data_preparation_utils import DataPreparationUtils.

In the main() function:

Ensure an instance of DataPreparationUtils is created.

Confirm the correct calls to load invoice data: data_utils.load_kaggle_invoice_dataset(KAGGLE_INVOICES_DIR) and data_utils.load_synthetic_invoice_dataset(SYNTHETIC_INVOICES_DIR).

Confirm the correct calls to unify and split the data: unified_samples = data_utils.unify_dataset_format(all_loaded_samples) and train_data, val_data = data_utils.create_train_val_split(unified_samples, VAL_SPLIT).

Remove any redundant internal data loading classes/functions: Ensure KaggleInvoiceDataLoader (if it exists) and any other standalone data loading/preprocessing functions that DataPreparationUtils now covers are removed.

Verify Dynamic Label Mappings:

The create_dynamic_label_mappings(unified_samples) function is present in your provided file and its logic seems correct for generating B-I-O tags from unique NER tags.

Confirm its usage: Ensure main() correctly calls id_to_label, label_to_id, num_labels = create_dynamic_label_mappings(unified_samples) using the unified_samples from DataPreparationUtils.

Validate Bounding Box Handling:

DataPreparationUtils.unify_dataset_format is now responsible for ensuring bounding boxes are in [xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax] integer format and normalized to the 0-1000 range.

In LayoutLMDataset.__getitem__: Verify that the validated_boxes logic only performs a final clamping (max(0, min(1000, coord))) and x1>x0, y1>y0 check. It should not re-normalize or re-calculate min/max from pixel values, as this is already handled upstream by DataPreparationUtils. (Your provided LayoutLMv3_trainer.py already has this correct, so ensure it remains).

Confirm Training Optimizations:

Early Stopping: Ensure EarlyStoppingCallback is correctly configured in TrainingArguments and passed to the Trainer callbacks list. (Your provided file already has EARLY_STOPPING_PATIENCE and EARLY_STOPPING_THRESHOLD and applies the callback).

Mixed Precision (FP16): Ensure fp16=True is conditionally enabled based on torch.cuda.is_available(). (Your provided file has this).

Gradient Accumulation: Confirm gradient_accumulation_steps is set to 2 (or a suitable value) for smaller batch sizes. (Your provided file has this).

Logging Strategy: Verify eval_strategy="steps", save_strategy="steps", and eval_steps/save_steps are dynamically calculated for granular feedback. (Your provided file has this).

dataloader_num_workers: Confirm it remains 0 for wider compatibility. (Your provided file has this).

Refine compute_metrics:

The current compute_metrics is quite robust. Ensure it continues to use zero_division=0 in f1_score and classification_report to prevent errors from classes with no true samples.

Confirm it correctly handles label_id_to_name_map to convert predictions/labels back to string names for the report.

Model Saving and Label Mappings:

After training, ensure the fine-tuned model and processor are saved to OUTPUT_DIR / "fine_tuned_layoutlmv3".

CRITICAL: Ensure the label_id_to_name_map (the id_to_label dictionary) is also saved to the model's directory (e.g., as label_mappings.json). This is vital for inference, so the IDPInferenceEngine knows how to interpret the model's numerical outputs back into meaningful NER tags.

Final Cleanup and Documentation:

Remove any unused imports.

Ensure all docstrings are accurate and up-to-date with current functionality.

Maintain consistent and informative logging throughout.

The if __name__ == "__main__": block should simply call main() to allow standalone training execution.

Your final output should be the complete, refactored layoutlmv3_trainer.py file only, implementing all these specific checks and optimizations."
